# Goals
* One of our goals is to offload as much work as possible onto other projects. One example is using something like Bootstrap/MaterializeCSS instead of writing or own. This is not only good for our mental health, but it also brings attention to other excellent projects.
* Simplicity
  * We want this to be very easy and intuitive for users
  * In our experience, these systems tend to be difficult for users to navigate
* Cross-platform
  * We want to make sure that this project runs well for all users, whether you are using a browser with NoScript or the newest version of Chrome
  * We would like to have native applications for all major mobile devices (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, etc.) but the website should also be mobile-friendly

# TODO
- [] Login system
- [] User-classes e.g. Student, Teacher, Teaching-Assistant
  - We will need to allow users to be members of multiple classes, as it is common for someone to be both a student and a teaching-assistant.
  - It may be best to have this run on a per-class basis.
- [] Classes
